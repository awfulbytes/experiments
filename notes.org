* using framing for buffers
use the same technick but act on separate time-frames...
** DONE decouple from interpolation

- CLOSING NOTE [2025-04-29 Τρι 20:10] \\
  there is no need for decoupling.. i like it like
  this the generation should be responsible for
  interpolating
:END:
** TODO add more signal mangling algorithms
** TODO malform the accumulator to make PD
=phase distortion= is a nice and easy thing to do now that we have a DDS
a. +using an injection to change the slope of the accumulator mid generation makes the signal kinda folding.+
b. +we have to check at which point and onward in the lut i can make this happen... and what different positions do.+
c. +make this selectable+
d. or even modulated!!
e. use an aggressive mode to make change between distortion modes
   a. when i do index > amount the result is more aggressive
   b. if i make index = amount then we get a more normal effect.
   c. also if i add or subtract the phase differs in the audible output.
f. check out the notes in the sources for inspiration
** DONE should add leds for tracking
